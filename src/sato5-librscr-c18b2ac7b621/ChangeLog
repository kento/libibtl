2011-08-31 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr_hash_util.h/c : Added scr_hash_set/get_double.

	* scr_transfer.c : Only bother writing to the transfer file if we
	  successfully opened it.

	* scr.c : Added code to support async flush in 1.1-8.

2011-08-03 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Recording meta data in filemap and summary files instead of separate
	  meta data files.

	* scr_filemap.h,
	  scr_filemap.c : Added routines to set/get/unset meta for each file.

2011-07-30 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Changed filemap, summary, and index files to refer to dataset ids
	  rather than checkpoint ids.  Rebuild now rebuilds all datasets in cache
	  instead of just the most recent.  Not yet fully tested.

	* : Moved halt, flush, and nodes files from control directory to prefix
	  directory.  Now only written by rank 0 rather than all master nodes.

	* scr_scavenge.in : Renamed scr_flush to scr_scavenge and changed verbage
	  from flush and drain to scavenge where appropriate.  Flush was overloaded
	  to refer to different concepts and drain soon will be.

	* scr_hash.h,
	  scr_hash.c : Moved function to list integer keys from filemap to hash.
	  Fixed bug which was sorting integer keys as strings in scr_hash_sort_int().

2011-06-28 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr_env.h,
	  scr_env.c : Added file to isolate typical machine dependent code.

	* scr_dataset.h,
	  scr_dataset.c : Associates attributes with a set of files.  Extends
	  SCR to handle general output datasets rather than just checkpoints.

	* scr_err.h,
	  scr_err.c,
	  scr_err_serial.c : Write all messages to stdout (errors were going to stderr).
	  Include version number in all messages.  Added new scr_warn() function.

	* scr_io.h,
	  scr_io.c : Added functions to return current working directory and
	  to build the absolute path to a file.  Also added functions to compress
	  and decompress files.

	* scr_util.h,
	  scr_util.c : Added functions to pack and unpack integer types into a
	  buffer in network order.

	* scr_hash_util.h,
	  scr_hash_util.c : Added functions to set/get integer values.

	* scr_flush_file.c : Fixed bug that was returning with wrong code if
	  named checkpoint is invalid.

	* scr_hash.c : Modified code to use new pack / unpack functions.

	* scr_meta.h,
	  scr_meta.c : Modified code to use new get / set hash functions.  Also added
	  functions to record original directory specified by user at SCR_Route_file time.

	* scr_copy.c : Allow caller to specify parameters using options instead of arg order.

	* scr_dataset.h,
	  scr_dataset.c : Added functions to set / get / unset a dataset hash.

	* scr_conf.h,
	  scr.c : Added partial support for containers (available in flush and fetch,
	  but still need drain support).  Added code to record dataset attributes.  Added
	  code to remember original directories specified by caller, need support to
	  create them and delete them with checkpoint.

2011-06-10 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr_err.h,
	  scr_err_serial.c,
	  scr.c : Added version string to error messages.

2011-05-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr_hash.c,
	  tv_data_display.c,
	  tv_data_display.h : Updated to latest C++View files to restore printing capability
	  in TotalView.

2011-04-13 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr.c : Added scr_summary_read_v4_to_v5 to read old scr_summary.txt files and
	  convert them into equivalent v5 hash for backwards compatibility.  This enables
	  v1.1-8 to restart from checkpoints stored in v1.1-7 or earlier.

	* scr_hash.c,
	  scr_hash.h : Added scr_hash_sort to sort keys in hash by string, also modified
	  integer sort call to accept ascending or descending flag.

	* scr_index.c : Added --remove option to drop a directory from the index.

	* man/scr_index.1.in : Described format of --list output and added an example.

2011-04-06 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* man/scr_index.1.in : Added man page for scr_index, and removed references to
	  scr_check_complete.

	* doc/scr_users_manual.pdf,
	  doc/scr_developers_manual.pdf : Updated user's manual and renamed it.  Added
	  developer's manual.

2011-03-24 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr.c : Fixed bug regarding leaking group handles.

	* scr.c,
	  scr_hash_mpi.c : Moved MPI related functions for hash from scr.c to scr_hash_mpi.c.
	  Includes support for a sparse global exchange.

	* m4/x_ac_gcs.m4,
	  configure.ac : Added support for libgcs (generalized comm split library), which
	  enables one to split processes on arbitrary data.  Since this library is only at
	  LLNL currently, also added --with-gcs configure option and HAVE_LIBGCS compile flag
	  to enable it.

	* scr_hash.h,
	  scr_hash.c : Added scr_hash_getf(), similar to scr_hash_setf().
	  Added hash keys for XOR file header.

2010-12-20 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scr_io.h,
	  scr_io.c : Modified scr_read and scr_write to take (and print) file name.

	* scr_copy_xor.h,
	  scr_copy_xor.c : Moved what little remained in these files to scr_hash.h,
	  and dropped these files.

2010-12-16 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Simplified Makefile.am code, and better follow package conventions.
	  Thanks to Todd Gamblin.

	* m4/x_ac_yogrt.m4,
	  m4/x_ac_mysql.m4 : Disable these configure options by default.

2010-12-15 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Restructured source layout to place all files in the same
	  directory again.  Quicken build by adding scr_base and scr_cmds
	  libs which the runtime library and scr commands now depend on.

2010-12-15 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scripts/scr_flush_files.in,
	  scripts/scr_retries_halt.in : Dropped these files since commands
	  are now implemented in C in src/bin.

	* scripts/scr_hash.pm : Scripts no longer access hash files
	  directly, so dropped this file.

	* scripts/scr_check_complete.in,
	  man/ : Replaced with scr_index command.

	* m4 : created subdirectory to hold m4 configure scripts,
	  added script to extract build flags from MPI wrappers.

	* : Restructuing build (yet again) to improve build speed.

2010-12-10 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Completed conversion of meta data to hash.

	* src/bin/scr_nodes_file.c : Added to read nodes file and print
	  number of nodes used in previous run, called by scr_env --runnodes.

	* src/bin/scr_flush_file.c,
	  src/bin/scr_retries_halt.c : Converted command from perl to C so
	  that we can drop support for scr_hash.pm.

	* src/bin/scr_index.c : Added --list option to list checkpoints
	  along with flags, flush times, and associated directories.

	* src/scr_hash_util.{c,h} : Includes various functions to simplify
	  certain hash operations.

2010-07-02 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Restructured src directory layout.

	* cmds/scr_index.c : Added command to replace scr_check_complete,
	  which builds summary file and adds checkpoint dir to index file
	  in prefix directory.

	* scripts/scr_test_hostlist.in,
	  scripts/scr_test_runtime.in,
	  scripts/Makefile.am : Dropped test for Hostlist module now that
	  scr_hostlist.pm is provided.

2010-06-25 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added scr.index file to track checkpoint flush directories
	  over time.  Dropped scr.old symlink.

	  Still need to update scr_postrun to update index.

2010-06-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr_meta.h,
	  src/scr_meta.c : Convert meta file format to hash.

	* src/scr.c,
	  scripts/scr_check_complete.in : Convert scr_summary.txt file to hash.

	* src/scrf.h,
	  src/scrf.c : Added Fortran77 support.

	* examples/test_ckpt.C : Added test for C++ codes using the C interface.

2010-06-17 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.h : Added extern "C" to improve support for C++ codes.

	* src/scr.c : Added check to abort if user calls SCR_Start_checkpoint twice
	  without a call to SCR_Complete_checkpoint in between.

2010-06-03 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-7

	* src/Makefile.am : Replace straight cp with libtool --mode=install cp to fix
	  minor make install bug when doing consecutive make installs.

2010-05-11 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scripts/scr_hostlist.pm,
	  scripts/scr_list_down_nodes.in,
	  scripts/scr_flush.in,
	  scripts/scr_inspect.in,
	  scripts/scr_glob_hosts.in,
	  scripts/scr_test_runtime.in,
	  scripts/README : Replaced Hostlist.pm with scr_hostlist.pm to remove dependency.

	* scripts/scr_check_complete.in : Don't add entries for XOR files in scr_summary.txt
	  to fix bug in scr_fetch_files() which expects only FULL files to be listed.

2010-04-19 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* examples/makefile.examples.in : Removed hardcoded -lyogrt library from link line.

	* scripts/scr_test_hostlist.in,
	  scripts/scr_test_datemanip.in,
	  scripts/scr_test_runtime.in,
	  scripts/scr_prerun.in : Add checks for pdsh and dshbak commands, as well as,
	  Hostlist and Date::Manip perl modules.  Called from scr_prerun with fatal error.

	* config/x_ac_prog_mpicc.m4 : Dropped check for MPICXX and modified check to
	  default MPICC to mpicc if nothing is found.

2010-04-06 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* config/x_ac_prog_pdsh : Changed check for pdsh and dshbak commands from fatal errors
	  to warnings, simply call pdsh and dshbak if not found.  It may be a better option to
	  drop absolute path and just always calls "pdsh" or "dshbak".

	* scripts/scr_list_down_nodes.in,
	  scripts/scr_srun.in : Add --log flag and an additional call to scr_list_down_nodes
	  to print reason to screen.  Disable logging unless --log is specified.

	* scripts/scr_check_node.in : Added test to touch and rm a file from directories.

2010-04-01 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added logic to support SCR_GLOBAL_RESTART.  When enabled, SCR will
	  distribute files on a restart, flush, and then clear the cache of all checkpoints.
	  Useful for codes which must restart from the parallel file system.  Also fixed
	  a bug where flush file was not being restored to a consistent state on a rebuild.

	* src/scr_io.c,
	  src/scr_rebuild_xor.c,
	  src/scr.c : Modified scr_read_pad_n and scr_write_pad_n to return an error
	  rather than exit upon an I/O failure.  Modified XOR rebuild to handle such
	  errors, with the intent to better detect failures when the parallel file system
	  is full.

2010-03-30 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr_io.c,
	  src/scr_io.h : Added scr_read_attempt and scr_write_attempt to return
	  error if read or write fails.  Have scr_copy_to return error if there
	  is a failure and also unlink destination file.

2010-03-24 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-6

	* README : merged deps.txt into README.

2010-03-22 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* doc/scr.pdf : Updated user manual to match new implementation.

2010-03-12 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr_meta.c,
	  src/scr_meta.h,
	  src/scr_rebuild_xor.c,
	  src/scr.c : Moved scr_compute_crc from scr to scr_meta so it could be called by
	  scr_rebuild_xor.  Now compute CRC after an XOR rebuild at drain time.

2010-03-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scripts/scr_param.pm.in,
	  scripts/scr_list_down_nodes.in,
	  scripts/scr_cntl_dir.in : Added support to run without system config file.  Need
	  to be sure any compile-time settings in here also match those in scr_conf.h.
	  And param->get_hash(), now returns a reference to hash, instead of a hash.

	* src/scr.c : Added scr_in_checkpoint flag which gets set to 1 in Start_checkpoint
	  and back to zero in Complete_checkpoint.  Route_file checks this flag to determine
	  whether it is being called in between Start/Complete or not.  If not, Route_file
	  now returns an error if the routed filename cannot be accessed.

	* src/scr_meta.h,
	  src/scr_meta.c,
	  src/scr_copy_xor.c,
	  src/scr.c,
	  scripts/scr_check_complete.in : Dropped src_ fields from meta data structure
	  and file, which have not been needed for some time.

	* scr.mysql,
	  src/scr_log.c : Added a types table to enable type string to id lookups,
	  and added some more indicies to events and transfers table to speed expected
	  queries.

	* src/scr_io.c,
	  src/scr_io.h,
	  src/scr_crc32.c,
	  src/scr.c : Added scr_crc32 and scr_compute_crc functions to compute a crc32
	  given a filename.  Added scr_crc_on_copy for LOCAL and XOR (done in copy files)
	  set crc32 value at Complete checkpoint.  Added scr_crc_on_delete to check crc32
	  on file before deleting from the cache (to monitor for bad drives in cache).

	* src/scr_conf.h : Consolidated compile-time defaults to a single file which
	  all other files include.

2010-02-19 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* doc/scr.pdf : Updated scr.pdf to better match current version.

2010-02-09 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* scripts/scr_prerun.in : Don't rm cache and control directories.  Didn't seem
	  to be necessary in practice, and avoid risk that user or admin mistypes the
	  cache or control base such that an rm -rf is done at the wrong level.

	* scripts/scr_srun.in : Fixed bug to handle case when calling scr_env --runnodes
	  when no node file exists.

	* src/scr.c : Fixed bug when writing exit reason to halt file.  Fixed minor bugs
	  when reporting checkpoint number on rebuild.

	* : Changed build system to use MPICC on scr library but CC on everything else.
	  Basic serial utilities programs had MPI library dependency otherwise.

2010-02-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Fixed bug in Need_checkpoint where only rank 0 was calling broadcast
	  when checkpoint whether it was time to halt.

2010-02-01 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Added support for a user configuration file in addition to compile-time constants
	  and the system configuration file.

	* : Added code to enable multiple checkpoint configurations using multiple caches
	  within a single run.  Reads configuration from user config file.

2010-01-12 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Converted filemap, nodes, and halt files to use hash file format.
	    Added initial code for asynchronous flush support.
	    Fixed efficiency bug which caused each file to be flushed twice under XOR.

2009-12-21 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : retag scr-1.1-5

	* : Prepared and uploaded tarball for distribution on sourceforge.

2009-12-04 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-5

	* : Converted to use autoconf tools.

	* src/scr_param.h,
	  src/scr_param.c : Added support for configuration file.

	* src/scr_log.h,
	  src/scr_log.c,
	  src/scr_log_event.c,
	  src/scr_log_transfer.c : Added support for logging events and file
	  transfers.

2009-10-01 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-4

	* src/scr.c : Added some logic to SCR_Need_checkpoint based on settings
	  user sets via SCR_CHECKPOINT_{OVERHEAD,SECONDS,FREQUENCY} variables.

	* bin.in/scr_check_limits,
	  bin.in/scr_cache_dir : Call scr_cache_dir to get cache directory
	  for checking limits.  Override /tmp via SCR_CACHE_BASE.

	* bin.in/scr_srun : Added logic to track and record run time of each step
	  and node failures in syslog.

2009-09-09 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Removed more references to slurm and /tmp where found.

	* src/scr_io.c : Return SCR_SUCCESS if scr_mkdir() succeeds,
	  and SCR_FAILURE otherwise.

	* src/scr.c : Check return code on mkdir of cache and cntl directories.

2009-09-04 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Separated cache into control (job state files) and cache (checkpoint
	  file cache) so that user can target different directories (i.e., devices)
	  to use as the cache.  Keep the control in a well-known location so SCR
	  utility scripts know where to look for files.

	* test/test_common.h,
	  test/test_common.c : Consolidated code common to test_correctness.c
	  and test_correctness_1.1.c.

	* bin.in/scr_check_limits: Renamed scr_report_tmp_limits to remove reference
	  to /tmp.

	* : Now set SCR_PREFIX to current working directory if not specified.

2009-08-20 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Added logic to makefile to support AIX.  Moved bin/in to bin.in and
	  man/man1/in to man.in/man1 to that "make clean" can simply remove bin
	  and man directories.

	* src/scr.c : Fixed a bug that led to calling MPI_Comm_split with negative
	  color values during SCR_Init().  Fixed another bug when calling MPI_Bcast
	  using receive buffers with an upper bound rather than the precise byte
	  counts.  Fixed a bug with calling dirname/basename recursively without
	  a strdup of the result.  Modified flock() calls to adhere to stricter AIX
	  requirements.

	* src/scr_meta.h,
	  src/scr_meta.c : Extracted meta data functions from scr_io.c into their
	  own file for consistency.

	* src/scr_crc32.c : Impelement crc32 command functionality to remove
	  dependency.

	* bin.in/scr_glob_hosts : Uses Hostlist.pm to implement functionality
	  needed from glob-hosts to remove dependency.

	* bin.in/scr_env : Abstracts most uses of SLURM commands to a single
	  interface, which should reduce the effort in supporting other resource
	  managers.  Still heavy use in scr_halt.

2009-07-21 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-3

	* bin/in/scr_retries_halt : Another bug -- forgot to chomp the cache_dir
	  output to strip the trailing newline.

2009-07-17 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-2

	* src/scr.c,
	  src/scr_halt.c
	  src/scr_halt_cntl.c,
	  include/scr_halt.h : Protect access to halt file with flock.  Added
	  command to be invoked on node 0 from scr_halt to access and modify halt
	  file.  This lets user change halt settings without worrying about state
	  of application as both the script and the app coordinate via flock().

	* src/scr_hash.c : Fixed heap courruption bug.

	* bin/in/scr_retries_halt : Fixed script typo.

2009-07-07 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.1-1

	* doc/manual/scr.tex : Updated user manual with more detail on the interpose
	  library and the steps needed to integrate the API into an application.

2009-07-01 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : retag scr-1.1-0

	* bin/in/scr_cache_dir: Added script to return checkpoint cache directory name.
	    Changed default cache location from /tmp/scr to /tmp/username/scr.jobid.
	    Added code to scr_prerun to delete the cache in a new job (in case user
	    had a previous run with the same id on a system that does not clear /tmp).

2009-06-29 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* bin/in/scr_flush_file: Added to run queries against new flush file format.
	    Modified scr_postrun, scr_flush, and scr_copy to call on scr_flush_file.

2009-06-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : Changed the API and updated the implementation.  Lots of big changes:
	  - Removed SCR_Start/Route/Complete.
	  - Added SCR_Need_checkpoint/Start_checkpoint/Route_file/Complete_checkpoint.
	  - Added data structures and logic to track multiple files per process per checkpoint.
	    Now each process may write 0 or more files per checkpoint.
	  - Can now store a rolling window of checkpoints in the cache, set SCR_CACHE_SIZE.
	  - Can now run (and restart) with a different number of processes per node.
	  - Removed first XOR algorithm altogether, changed XOR2 to XOR.
	  - Updated scr_interpose to use new API and handle multiple files per process.
	  - Updated text_correctness.c to use new API and created test_correctness_1.1.c.
	  - Updated scr.pdf to discuss new API and features.

2009-05-04 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0-19

	* src/scr_xor2_rebuild.c : Fixed bug in printf statements
	  where file descriptor was being printed instead of file
	  name.  Led to core dumps on rebuild attempts.

	* package.conf : Set OPT to -g -O3 before make to ensure
	  optimization is enabled for production build.

	* src/scr.c : Changed MPI_CHAR to MPI_BYTE.

2009-04-20 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0-18

	* src/scr.c : Added XOR2 copy and rebuild logic.
	  Moved old XOR to XOR1 and set copy_xor2 as new XOR.
	  Set SCR_XOR_SIZE=8 and SCR_COPY_TYPE=XOR as new defaults.
	  Fixed SCR_PARTNER_DISTANCE to select different
	  nodes for xor sets, e.g., every other node, etc.

	* src/scr_io.c,
	  src/scr_err_serial.c,
	  src/scr_copy_xor2.c,
	  include/scr_io.h,
	  include/scr_err.h,
	  include/scr_copy_xor2.h : Moved shared code to separate files.

	* bin/in/scr_check_complete,
	  src/scr_xor_rebuild.c,
	  src/scr_xor2_rebuild.c : Added code to rebuild missing files
	  via XOR2 redundancy scheme.  Fixed a bug to rescan .scr files
	  before writing scr_summary.txt file after a rebuild.

2009-02-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0-17

	* src/scr.c : Fixed bug in SCR_Route to echo passed in filename when
	  SCR is disabled.  Also have SCR_Init create the directory in this case.
	  Added crc32 capability to flush/fetch opertaions, and now try
	  /old if fetch of /current fails.

	* src/scr_interpose.c,
	  bin/in/srun-scr : Updated to match latest API and scr.h.

	* bin/in/scr_srun : Merged srun-scr into scr_srun, sets LD_PRELOAD if
	  SCR_CHECKPOINT_PATTERN is set.

	* bin/scr_list_down_nodes,
	  bin/in/scr_srun : Added logic to continue to exclude nodes if they
	  are ever marked down, even if they come back healthy to avoid deleting
	  a checkpoint set during distribute on a restart.

	* bin/in/scr_check_complete,
	  etc/scr_meta.pm,
	  bin/in/scr_copy : Added crc32 option to scr_copy to compute crc32 value
	  of files and update meta data files before copying files to the parallel file system.
	  Updated scr_check_complete to match new scr_summary.txt format.  Added scr_meta.pm
	  to abstract reading and writing of meta data files.

2009-01-15 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0-16

	* src/scr.c : Added SCR_FLUSH_ON_RESTART to force a flush on restart.
	  Fixed bug where a flush could be missed when restarting.

	* bin/in/scr_srun : Added SCR_EXCLUDE_NODES to manually avoid known
	  problem nodes in scr_srun.

	* bin/scr_srun,
	  bin/scr_prerun,
	  bin/scr_postrun : Added logic to process SCR_ENABLE.

	* bin/scr_srun : Changed SCR_RETRIES to SCR_RUNS which is less confusing.

	* man/* : Added man pages for user interface commands.

2008-12-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_15
	
	* src/scr.c : Typo in debug output in fetch and flush.

2008-12-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_14
	
	* src/scr.c : Forgot to print debug output in scr_copy_files.

2008-12-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_13

	* src/scr.c : Fixed some bugs for the flush with XOR.  Changed scr_fetch
	  to be non-fatal per Bert's request and updated SCR_FLUSH to go by global
	  checkpoint id (also now read in global checkpoint id during scr_fetch).

2008-12-01 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added SCR_Route() to build full path to checkpoint file.
	  Added support for SCR_FETCH to read files in from Lustre into /tmp
	  during SCR_Init.  Added support for SCR_FLUSH to flush files out to
	  Lustre with some frequency in SCR_Complete.

	* : changed "drain" to "flush" to better match cache terminology.

	* bin/in/scr_flush.in : Added case in failed pdsh where scr_flush
	  was missing retrying after a failed node.

2008-11-04 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : retag scr-1.0_11

	* package.conf,
	  makefile,
	  docs/manual/makefile : Add scr.pdf as binary file rather than
	  try to build pdf via latex source during package build.

2008-11-03 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_11

	* docs/*,
	  makefile,
	  README : Added scr.pdf documentation built from latex via pdflatex.
	  Point readers of README file to scr.pdf file.

	* bin/in/scr_halt.in,
	  bin/in/scr_retries_halt.in,
	  setdir : Added tmp prefix to scr_halt.
	  Added a number of new options to scr_halt, -c, -b, -a, -r.
	  Created scr_retries_halt to check whether retries should be halted
	  based on info in halt file.

	* test/test_correctness.c : Added sleep option to sleep between checkpoints.
	  Added usage if given incorrect number of options.

2008-10-27 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Now unlink xor segments as they are gathered and appended
	  one-by-one to the XOR file during the gather.  (Need to conserve memory.)
	  Changed 'SCR aborting' to 'Job exiting' which is less alarming.  Rewrote
	  XOR algorithm to keep data in memory longer during reduce-scatter.  Added
	  checkpoint id to drain.scrinfo file.

	* bin/in/scr_check_complete.in,
	  setdir : Added logic to rebuild missing checkpoint files
	  from XOR segments if possible.  Moved file to /in directory
	  since it now calls scr_xor_rebuild.

	* src/scr_xor_rebuild.c,
	  makefile : The C program to actually rebuild missing checkpoint
	  files from XOR segments.

	* bin/scr_report_tmp_limits,
	  bin/scr_prerun : Added "scr_" prefix to report_tmp_limits to be consistent.

	* bin/scr_prerun,
	  bin/scr_postrun : Changed -f (from) and -t (to) options to be -p (prefix)
	  and -t (tmp), which is less confusing.  Dropped old -p (pattern) and -c (ppn)
	  options since they weren't used anyway.

	* bin/scr_halt : Renamed scr_kill to scr_halt.  Have script mkdir /tmp/scr in
	  case it tries to touch halt file before the directory has been created.

	* bin/in/scr_drain.in,
	  bin/scr_copy : When given an --id <id> argument, only copy files from node
	  if there is a drain file and its id matches the one requested.

	* bin/scr_list_down_nodes,
	  bin/in/scr_srun.in,
	  bin/in/scr_drain.in : Print list of down (according to SLURM down state)
	  or unresponsive nodes (according to ping test) to stdout.  Used to exclude
	  nodes in scr_drain and scr_srun.

2008-06-29 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added SCR_Read() and SCR_Write() calls as simple wrappers.

	* src/scr.c,
	  test/test_copy.c,
	  test/test_correctness.c,
	  test/test_demo.c,
	  test/test_interpose.c,
	  test/test_openclose.c,
	  test/test_signal.c,

	  not export symbols externally.

2008-04-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : retag scr-1.0_10

	* pacakge.conf : Had to reorder make / setdir commands since
	  make includes a clean, which now cleans up the scripts in /bin.

2008-04-23 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_10

	* test/test_demo.c : Added simulated application
	  which repeatedly computes and writes new checkpoints
	  at each timestep.

	* src/scr.c,
	  bin/scr_copy : Added scr_need_drain() and scr_halt()
	  functions which write out drain.scrinfo and halt.scrinfo
	  files respectively in /tmp/scr to pass info to postrun scripts.

	* bin/scr_kill : Kill jobs by touching halt.scrinfo file in /tmp/scr
	  via pdsh command to entire nodeset of job.

	* bin/in/scr_srun.in,
	  setdir : Wrapper of scr_prerun/srun/retries/scr_postrun.

	* bin/in/scr_postrun.in : Set SCR_MARK_COMPLETE to be on be default.

	* makefile : Created 'scripts' target, clean scripts in make clean,
	  and added test_demo.c

2008-04-22 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : retag scr-1.0_9

	* src/scr. : Forgot to guard filemap with scr_distribute flag.
	  Set scr_copy to ignore *.filemap files (since these don't have
	  unique names yet).

2008-04-22 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_9

	* src/scr. : Implemented distribution logic for XOR files.
	  Moved Async to type=3, now Local=0, which has no copy.

2008-04-10 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr. : Most funtions now return SCR_SUCCESS or something
	  other than SCR_SUCCESS upon failure.  Fixed a bug in
	  scr_split_path.

	* makefile : Added OPT variable to makefile to quickly change
	  optimization flags.  Building with -O3 vs -O0 has a big impact
	  on the XOR performance.

2008-03-26 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added scr_distributefiles() and related functions
	  which shuffle files around during MPI_Init() with the goal
	  of priming up spare nodes to take over for failed nodes.

	  Also added scr_xorcopy() and related functions which computes
	  an xor file for a group of checkpoint files and distributes
	  the blocks of the xor files over the nodes.

2008-03-17 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_8

	* src/scr.c,
	  include/scr.h : Added SCR_Open and SCR_Close calls.
	  Added scr_err and scr_dbg calls to print messages.
	  Added code to create xor file fragments from checkpoint
	  files, reduces memory footprint.

	* test/test_openclose.c : Added test for SCR_Open/Close.

2008-03-06 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_7

	* makefile : Copy .so files to lib instead of lib/shared.

	* package.conf : Cleaned up copy of files during install
	  using $bindir, $libdir, etc from dpkg-mkdeb.

2008-03-05 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_6

	* package.conf : Changed to use $lccdir and $pkgname which
	  are macros defined by the dpkg-mkdeb script.

2008-02-11 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_4

	* package.conf,
	  setdir : Write to /usr/local/etc/lcc instead of
	  /usr/local/etc/lcc-plugins.  Set @PREFIX@ to $prefix
	  since we'll source scr .macros file.  Use PKG_DEFAULT=scr.

	* scr.plugin.in,
	  scr.lcc.in : Renamed plugin file.

2008-02-06 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* package.conf : Set short desc to match format of MPI libraries.

2007-12-17 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* : tag scr-1.0_3

	* bin/scr_flush,
	  bin/in/presrun,
	  bin/in/postsrun,
	  setdir : Cleanup of bin directory: removed scr_flush,
	  renamed presrun to scr_prerun and postsrun to scr_postrun.

	* EXAMPLES,
	  IMPLEMENTATIONS : Removed during cleanup.

	* README : Added note about SCR_USE_SIGNAL, SCR_ABORT_SIGNAL,
	  and SCR_IMMABORT_SIGNAL.  Changed presrun / postsrun references.

	* src/scr.c : Added support for SCR_IMMABORT_SIGNAL, which
	  is a second registered signal that aborts the job immediately.

	* src/src_utility.c : Added code to handle EINTR and EAGAIN errors
	  on read and write.

	* bin/scr_kill : A script to safely kill an scr job via sending signals.

2007-12-14 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added scr_use_signal_immediate as placeholder.
	  Want to enable user have choice between
	    1) exit immediately (unless in middle of checkpoint)
	    2) abort at end of next checkpoint, whenever that may be
	  Currently only supports option 2, we could catch a second
	  signal or read variable setting to also enable mode 1.

	* makefile,
	  test/test_signal.c : Link statically.  Removed Awake printf.

	* src/scr_old.c : Moved to dev since signal code added in main
	  scr.c file now.

2007-12-14 Adam Moody <moody20@llnl.gov>

	* src/scr.c : Added signal handler to safely abort job, i.e.,
	  don't want to kill it during the middle of a checkpoint.

	* package.conf : Updated to VERSION 2.

	* package.conf : Remove src/dev subdirectory during install.

	* package.conf : Removed PKG_DEPENDS=lcc (only build-time dependency).
