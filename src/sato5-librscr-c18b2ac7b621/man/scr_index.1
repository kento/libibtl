.TH scr_index 1  "" "scr-1.1-8" "scr"
.SH NAME
scr_index \- manages status of checkpoints stored on parallel file system

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "scr_index [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBscr_index\fR command manages checkpoints stored on the parallel
file system.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-l, --list "
List contents of index (default behavior).
.TP
.BI "-a, --add " DIR
Add checkpoint directory to index.
.TP
.BI "-r, --remove " DIR
Remove checkpoint directory from index.  Does not delete corresponding files.
.TP
.BI "-p, --prefix"
Specify prefix directory (defaults to current working directory).
.TP
.BI "-h, --help"
Print usage.

.LP
When adding a directory to the index, the command checks
that the checkpoint directory on the parallel file system contains a
complete and valid set of checkpoint files, it rebuilds missing
checkpoint files if possible, and it writes an \fIscr_summary.txt\fR
file, which is used by the SCR library to fetch and redistribute files
to appropriate ranks upon a restart.

One may invoke the command outside of a SLURM job allocation, which is
useful to check and rebuild a checkpoint set in which \fBscr_postrun\fR
may have failed to complete its internal call to \fBscr_index\fR.

When listing checkpoints, the internal SCR checkpoint id is shown,
along with the checkpoint directory name.  In addition, the time
the checkpoint was flushed is shown as well as a set of flags.
The flags are shown as a series of columns consisting of single characters.
The first column represents whether the checkpoint is complete.
An 'x' in the first column implies the checkpoint is incomplete while 'c' means the checkpoint is complete.
An 'f' in the second column indicates that SCR has marked the checkpoint as failed.
During a restart, SCR will not attempt to fetch a checkpoint that is marked as incomplete or failed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
(1) List checkpoint direcotries in index file:
.nf
>> scr_index --list
FLAGS  FLUSHED              CKPT  DIRECTORY
c-     2011-04-11T17:59:27    18  scr.2011-04-11_17:59:27.427417.18
c-     2011-04-11T17:59:24    12  scr.2011-04-11_17:59:24.427417.12
c-     2011-04-11T17:59:21     6  scr.2011-04-11_17:59:21.427417.6
.fi
.TP
(2) Add checkpoint directory to index file, rebuild missing checkpoint files if necessary, and create summary file:
.nf
>> scr_index --add scr.2008-10-20_14:22:10.23167.50
.fi
