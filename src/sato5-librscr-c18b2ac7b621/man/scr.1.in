.SH DESCRIPTION
The Scalable Checkpoint / Restart (SCR) library provides an interface that
codes may use to write out and read in application-level checkpoints in a
scalable fashion.  In the current implementation, checkpoint files are
cached in local storage (hard disk or RAM disk) on the compute nodes.
This technique provides scalable aggregate bandwidth and uses storage
resources that are fully dedicated to the job.  This approach addresses
the two common drawbacks of checkpointing a large-scale application to
a shared parallel file system, namely, limited bandwidth and file system
contention.  In fact, on current platforms, SCR scales linearly with the
number of compute nodes.  It has been benchmarked as high as 720GB/s
on 1094 nodes of Atlas, which is nearly two orders of magnitude faster
than the parallel file system.
